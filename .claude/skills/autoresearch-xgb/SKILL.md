description: Autonomous XGBoost research agent. Given a Unity Catalog table and target column, profiles the data, creates a right-sized cluster, runs iterative experiments via Command Execution API, and produces a polished Databricks notebook. Use when asked to "research", "auto-train", "find the best model", or "explore and train" on a dataset.

# AutoResearch: XGBoost on Databricks

Autonomous agent that explores a dataset and produces the best XGBoost model
it can find within a time budget. The output is a well-documented Databricks
notebook uploaded to the workspace.

## Inputs

Extract from the user's request:

| Input | Required | Example | Default |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `table` | yes | `brian_gen_ai.xgb_scaling.imbalanced_10m` | — |
| `target_col` | yes | `label` | — |
| `budget_minutes` | no | `45` | `60` |

Parse `catalog`, `schema`, `table_name` from the three-part table identifier.

## Checklist

Copy this and track progress:

```
- [ ] Phase 1: PROFILE — Profile the dataset via SQL warehouse
- [ ] Phase 2: SIZE & CREATE — Calculate cluster size, create cluster + context
- [ ] Phase 3: FEATURE ENG — Run feature engineering cells on live cluster
- [ ] Phase 4: TRAIN — Run baseline + experiments, compare results
- [ ] Phase 5: FINALIZE — Clean up notebook, register model, teardown
```

## Phase 1: PROFILE

See [phase-1-profile.md](phase-1-profile.md).

Run SQL queries via the SQL Statement API against a warehouse to collect row
count, column types, cardinality, nulls, class distribution, and basic stats.
No cluster needed.

## Phase 2: SIZE & CREATE

See [phase-2-cluster.md](phase-2-cluster.md).

Estimate memory from profile, pick cluster config from decision table, create
cluster via REST API, wait for RUNNING, create execution context. While waiting,
scaffold the notebook skeleton locally.

## Phase 3: FEATURE ENGINEERING

See [phase-3-features.md](phase-3-features.md).

Run cells on the live cluster to load data, encode categoricals, handle nulls,
detect skew, cap feature count, split train/test. Each step is a code cell with
markdown explanation. Upload notebook to workspace after this phase (crash
recovery checkpoint).

## Phase 4: TRAIN & EVALUATE

See [phase-4-train.md](phase-4-train.md).

Run baseline XGBoost, then 1-2 variations if budget allows. Read metrics from
MLflow API. Stop early if no improvement after 2 experiments. Upload notebook
after each training run.

## Phase 5: FINALIZE

See [phase-5-finalize.md](phase-5-finalize.md).

Compare results, register best model to UC, add summary to notebook top, upload
final notebook, terminate cluster, report to user.

## Error Handling

- Cell error → read error, one retry with fix, if still fails log in markdown
- Cluster dies → save local notebook, upload partial, report to user
- OOM → log error, try fewer features or smaller sample
- Budget exceeded → skip remaining experiments, go to Phase 5
- No metric improvement after 2 experiments → stop early, go to Phase 5
